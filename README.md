# Hello World !

### This is the third homework from the FrontEnd course within the Principal33 internship.

### The homework is to integrate Firebase over the Employee CMS we've made.

Adding an employee should insert an employee into a Firebase DB.

Populating the employee table should show all the Employees in the Firebase DB.

Sorting, filtering and searching should also be done on the Firebase DB using the .filter and .sort tools provided by Firebase.

You can use either Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore.
